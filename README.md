This python code will download 10 latest tweets from twitter using consumer key,consumer secret,access token,access secret. And downloaded tweets will get stored in cassandra database having two columns(id and tweets). I have created one class named client having 3 methods which are used to connect to cassandra database and also to create keyspace and table.
